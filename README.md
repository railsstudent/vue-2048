# vue-2048

## Problem Statement

This application is a 2048 game where player merges tiles together to create tile 2048 to win.

## Architecture

This project was generated with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) version 3.0.1.

The game is composed of a Board component that designs game layout and board with FlexBox and CSS grid. The component adopts Single File Architecture (SFA) where source file encapsulates HTML template SCSS and JS logic.

## Technology Stack
* `Vue 2`  - JavaScript framework
* `SCSS`   - style all components in the application
* `JavaScript` - logic of board component is written in JavaScript and ES6
* `Jest` - write and test JavaScript test codes
* `Cypress` - execute e2e tests in browser
* `Eslint + Prettier` - lint JavaScript codes and format files

# Area of Improvements
1. ~~This project is currently without e2e testing. Test cases will be implemented after grasping the concepts of Cypress.io~~
2. Store highest score in local storage of browser
